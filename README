About STBase Libs
------------------

This is version 1.0 of STBase libraries.

STBase libs are multiplattform libraries

STBase (Softtopia Toolkit Base) is a set of multiplatform C++ libraries that extends Qt (http://qt.nokia.com/) libraries to improve it the following areas:

- Database data persistance. 
- Imaging 
- Printing
- GUI
- Input/Output
- Programming patterns
- Network

STBase depends on Qt libs and CMake build system. It provides several CMake modules to use and build only the libs or parts of STBase than we need. 
STBase libs are multiplarform and are tested in GNU/Linux, Windows and MacOSX.

There is also an extension of STBase focused to fotography called STPhoto. Se more info of STPhoto in: http://www.softtopia.com/stphoto
